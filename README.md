# Rock-Paper-Scissor-AI

A Rock Paper Scissors AI which we can play against. Created using an Artifical Neural Network.

Implemented transfer learning to create this AI. Trained the last layer of the MobileNet model to componsate for the Rock, Paper and Scissors hand gestures. The model learned to generalize well and achieved an overall accuracy of 99%.

<h2>Testing:</h2>

First run the "requirements.txt" file in the terminal using the following command: pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt. It will install all the required dependencies. Then in the terminal run the "rps.py" file using the command: python3 /path/to/rps.py.
